function detectionClusters = clusterDetections(detections, vehicleSize)
% This function merges multiple detections suspected to be of the same vehicle to a single detection.
% The function looks for detections that are closer than the size of a vehicle. Detections that fit 
% this criterion are considered a cluster and are merged to a single detection at the centroid of the 
% cluster. The measurement noises are modified to represent the possibility that each detection can be
% anywhere on the vehicle. Therefore, the noise should have the same size as the vehicle size.
% 
% In addition, this function removes the third dimension of the measurement (the height) and reduces
% the measurement vector to [x;y;vx;vy].
